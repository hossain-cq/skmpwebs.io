    <h2>Research contributions</h2>
    <p>
      My research develops reproducible computational frameworks integrating
      first-principles physics, machine learning, and near-term quantum algorithms
      to address bottlenecks in materials discovery and chemical simulation.

      <h3>Quantum algorithms for spectral problems</h3>
      <p>
        I develop and apply quantum subspace and spectral filtering techniques
        (VQE, qEOM, SQD, and filtered-QPE) to resolve low-lying eigenstates,
        excitation energies, and dissociation pathways in molecular and
        materials systems where classical methods face exponential scaling.
      </p>
      <p>
        My focus is on algorithmic structure—active-space design, spectral
        isolation, and noise-aware subspace compression—rather than hardware
        benchmarking or black-box demonstrations.

      <h3>AI/ML for materials design</h3>
      <p>
        I build machine-learning models for materials property prediction and
        screening, with an emphasis on voltage prediction for alkali-ion battery
        materials. My work integrates physics-informed descriptors derived from
        DFT with modern neural architectures to improve accuracy, robustness,
        and interpretability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond predictive performance, I analyze feature importance, uncertainty,
        and data bias to ensure that ML models provide scientifically meaningful
        guidance rather than purely empirical correlations.

      <h3>First-principles simulation and workflow automation</h3>
      <p>
        I design high-throughput DFT and AIMD workflows for structural relaxation,
        thermodynamic analysis, and data extraction, with a strong emphasis on
        automation, provenance, and reproducibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        These workflows serve both as standalone computational studies and as
        structured data generators for downstream machine-learning and quantum
        simulation pipelines.

      <h3>Quantum chemistry benchmarking and validation</h3>
      <p>
        I apply quantum chemistry methods to molecular systems relevant to
        energy storage and functional materials, systematically benchmarking
        quantum algorithms against classical electronic-structure calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This work aims to identify realistic problem classes where near-term
        quantum methods provide qualitative or quantitative advantages, while
        clearly delineating their current limitations.
