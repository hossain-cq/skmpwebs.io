    <p>
      Computational materials research integrating physics-based simulation,
      machine learning, and quantum algorithms into reproducible
      scientific workflows.

      <h3>Research focus</h3>
      <p>
        My research centers on developing computational frameworks that
        reduce the cost and uncertainty of materials discovery by tightly
        coupling first-principles simulation (DFT and AIMD), data-driven
        learning, and emerging quantum algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I focus on problems where classical methods become computationally
        expensive or opaque, such as voltage prediction in complex battery
        materials and spectral calculations in correlated molecular systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to develop interpretable, physics-consistent
        computational frameworks that enable predictive materials discovery
        beyond the limits of classical simulation.

      <h3>Methodological approach</h3>
      <p>
        I design end-to-end research pipelines spanning simulation, data
        extraction, model construction, and validation, with a strong emphasis
        on reproducibility, interpretability, and methodological transparency.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my quantum computing work, I focus on spectral isolation and subspace
        compression techniques for chemistry and materials problems, rather than
        hardware benchmarking or black-box algorithm demonstrations.
